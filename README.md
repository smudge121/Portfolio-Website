# Portfolio-Wesbsite

## Description

In this project I created a web based portfolio to show case and past web development and programming related works.  This portfolio website will serve as a basis to be built upon as I grow my web development skills and create various new applications.  Through the course of this project, I learned a lot about css and flexbox.  

## Usage

This portfolio is hosted at this link: https://smudge121.github.io/Portfolio-Website/ 
  

To view the source code, download the project from this git repository.  The HTML, css, and image files are available.
